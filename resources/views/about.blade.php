   <p>This is a digital EPI management system to keep track of vaccination for child & woman. We will follow the WHO (World Health Organization) recognized EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) which started in Bangladesh since 7th April, 1979.</p>
   <p>In this system the vaccination program will be monitored and necessary data records will be conserved. An extension may be built to notify people about vaccination through wireless network system.</p>
   <p>In this project the necessary information about newborn, infant and woman health issues will be kept tracked of. It will be beneficial to any health professionals to have the data in digital format. District or sub district vaccination session can use this system to monitor the work flows.
